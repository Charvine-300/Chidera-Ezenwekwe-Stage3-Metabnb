## Reflection and Approach
The context of this project was to create a virtual home in the metaverse. It's kind of like Sims but in Web3 âœ¨

* I adopted the use of the Vite frontend tool in order to make development more convenient. 
* I made use of mixins in SASS to store variables and reusable style rules to ease the complexity of styling.
